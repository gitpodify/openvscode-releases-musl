# Extractor Dockerfiles

These Dockerfiles living here are for extracting the built-from-source binaries. If you need to extract them
for your own outside containers, you can download these Dockerfiles and run `docker build` followed by `docker cp`.

Note that you need to create the container first and get ahold of its ID before start copying files.
